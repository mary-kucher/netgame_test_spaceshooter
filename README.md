### Project "Space Shooter"

This project is a simple space shooter game created using HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, and the PIXI.js library.

#### Overview

In this game, you control a spaceship that can only move horizontally, shoot, and destroy asteroids. The goal is to destroy all asteroids before time runs out or you run out of bullets.

#### Technologies

- HTML: Used to create the main container for the game and place the canvas.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: All game logic is written in JavaScript or TypeScript.
- PIXI.js: A graphics library used to create graphical objects such as the spaceship, asteroids, bullets, and to display messages on the screen.

#### Instructions

1. Start the game by opening the [**Live Demo**](https://mary-kucher.github.io/spaceshooter/) in a web browser.
2. Control the spaceship using the "right" and "left" arrow keys.
3. Use the "space" key to shoot.
4. Destroy asteroids by shooting at them.
5. Win by destroying all asteroids before time runs out or by shooting the maximum number of bullets.
6. Check if you are playing on the second level and have defeated the Boss.

#### Additional Features

- **Primitive Graphics**: Graphics are created programmatically using PIXI.js.
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays a timer that limits the game time to 60 seconds.
- **On-Screen Messages**: Displays "YOU WIN" or "YOU LOSE" messages on the screen depending on the game result.
- **Second Level with Boss**: If all asteroids are destroyed, you advance to the second level where you encounter the Boss.
